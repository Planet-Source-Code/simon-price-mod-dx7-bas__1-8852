### Description

Mod_DX7.bas is a module of simple functions to make DirectX programming easier. Included is an example program which uses the module. All it does is bounce a ball over a background but it does it at a rather slick 89 frames per second (on my 400Mhz PC) and it prints the frame rate every second to the debug window for you to see. This is my first ever DirectX program so it will be useful for newbies to DirectX 7 (like me). I have since used this module to create my most graphically advanced game - aMAZEing 3D - to run in full 3D lighted textures at fast frame rates! Go look at my other submissions to see that. If this code is helpful, please vote for it.
